# Summary:
Here we will create classifier for cats and dogs using CNN

# Installations:
* ANALYZE: Pandas, numpy, jupyter, Pillow, matplotlib
* ML: tensorflow, keras [Installation guide](https://www.dataweekends.com/blog/2017/03/09/set-up-your-mac-for-deep-learning-with-python-keras-and-tensorflow)

#### GPU on mac
* [Using theano](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41340461/can-i-implement-deep-learning-models-in-my-laptop-with-intel-hd-graphics)
